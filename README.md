#### I am a student at *AGH UST in Cracow*, Poland and a hobbyist *graphic designer & illustrator*.

Currently, I am studying **Geophysics** :mortar_board:, in which my main interest is *Geo-electromagnetism*.
I love using programming as a tool for making graphs and visualisations for my lab reports.

As a graphic designer & illustrator, I enjoy looking at visually appealing websites and apps - that was the main reason why I started programming and set **my goal** to becoming a **Full-Stack Web Developer**.
